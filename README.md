# Deepthermal
Project for 401-4656-21L Deep Learning in Scientific Computing FS2021 at ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

Code from this project has been updated since i have used some of the functions in later projects. For the old project see the `old_usage` branch.  

The source files are placed `deepthermal/` directory.
The programs generating solutions to tasks are placed in `task_solutions/`. Final model parameters are also placed in this folder.
The tests are placed in `test/` directory. 

To run all the test run: 

```
python3 -m unittest
```
from in the top level directory.
